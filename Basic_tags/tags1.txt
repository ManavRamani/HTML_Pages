1). Level -> 1 -> HTML :

        -> HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language).
        -> HTML is the code that is used to Structer a web page and its content.
        -> The component used to design the Structer of websites are called HTML tags.

    * First HTML File :

        ->index.html
        -it is the default name for a website's home page

    * HTML Tag :

        -> A container for some content or other HTML tags.
        -<p>This is paragraph</p>
        -<p> -> this is Element

    * Basic HTML Page :

        -> basic Structer of html.

            <!DOCTYPE html>                 // Html 5 use
            <html>                          // root of an html document
            <head>                          // container for metadata
                <title>Manav Ramani</title> // Paghe title :
            </head>
            <body>                          // container all data show in crome...
                <p>Hello world</p>          // paragraph tag with content...
            </body>
            </html>

    * Quick Points :
        
        -> Html tag is parent of head & body tag.
        -> Most of html elements have opening & closing tags with content in between.
        -> Some tags have no content in between , eg - <br>
        -> We can use inspect element/view page source to edit html 

    * Comments in HTML :

        ->This is part of code that should not be parsed.
